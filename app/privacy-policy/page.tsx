              The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a
              big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect
              and why; how your data is handled; and your rights with respect to
              your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never
              will.

            <p>
              Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what
              that means in practice:

              {`${CompanyName} runs contextual ads on various third-party platforms
              such as Facebook. Users who click on one of our ads will be sent
              to the ${CompanyName} marketing site. Where permissible under law, we
              may load an ad-company script on their browsers that sets a
              third-party cookie and sends information to the ad network to
              enable evaluation of the effectiveness of our ads, e.g., which ad
              they clicked and which keyword triggered the ad, and whether they
              performed certain actions such as clicking a button or submitting
              a form.`}
            </p>
            <p>
              We also use persistent first-party cookies and some third-party
              cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to
              use our applications, and perform A/B testing as well as support
              some analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
              A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help
              remember login information and site preferences. It might also
              collect information such as your browser type, operating system,
              web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other
              click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings and
              accept or block individual cookies in your browser settings,
              although our apps won’t work and other aspects of our service may
              not function properly if you turn cookies off.

              as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
              <br />
              <strong>• Right of Access. </strong> This includes your right to
              access the personal information we gather about you, and your
              right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security
              and processing of that information.

              request correction of your personal information.
              <br />
              <strong>• Right to Erasure / “To Be Forgotten”. </strong> This is
              your right to request, subject to certain limitations under
              applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our
              possession and, by extension, from all of our service providers.
              Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from
              using Tarot Reader App services because our applications may then
              no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result
              in closing your account. To exercise this right, please contact us

              personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell

              could have a legal or similarly significant effect on you from
              being made solely based on automated processes. This right is

              you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer
              service because you have exercised your data privacy rights.
              However, the exercise of certain rights may, by virtue of your
              exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.
