          Dr. Arthur Edward Waite
        </a>{" "}
        (1857-1942), a renowned scholar of occultism, played a significant role
        in unraveling the secrets of the Tarot.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Waite's remarkable works, including "The Holy Kabbalah" and "The Key to
        the Tarot" (first published in England in 1910), demonstrated his deep
        understanding of the Tarot's symbolism. He famously stated, "The true
        tarot is symbolism; it speaks no other language and offers no other
        signs." But what do these Tarot cards signify, and where did they
        originate?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        The precise origins of Tarot cards in antiquity remain shrouded in
        mystery. In 1781, Court de Gebelin proposed a theory in his work, "Le
        Monde Primitif," suggesting that Tarot cards had their roots in an
        ancient Egyptian book known as "The Book of Thoth." Thoth, the Egyptian
        Mercury, was credited with inventing the hieroglyphic system, and
        Gebelin believed that the Tarot's wisdom was passed down from the
        Egyptians and Gypsies.
      </p>

      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Surprisingly, the emergence of Tarot cards in Europe predates Dr.
        Waite's influential work by over five centuries. In the historical
        records, a German monk named Johannes mentioned a card game called
        "Ludas Cartarum" played in 1377, offering a glimpse of the Tarot's early
        presence.
      </p>

      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Covelluzzo, a fifteenth-century chronicler, added to the mystery by
        documenting the introduction of card games in Viterbo in 1379, further
        fueling the Tarot's enigmatic history.
      </p>

      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        In 1369, a decree issued by Charles VI of France made no mention of
        playing cards. However, just 28 years later, the Prevot of Paris issued
        an ordinance on January 22, 1397, forbidding working people from
        engaging in various activities, including playing cards, except on
        holidays. This marked the growing popularity of playing cards in Europe,
        hinting at their historical significance.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        It is widely believed that playing cards found their way to Europe in
        the latter half of the fourteenth century, possibly originating in Italy
        as a complete 78-card deck. This deck combined the common 56 cards,
        known as the{" "}

        , forming the 78-card Tarot pack we know today.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        During the fifteenth century, Tarot cards were often hand-drawn or
        painted for princely houses in Northern Italy and France. Subsequently,
        they were reproduced through woodcuts, stencils, and copper engraving,
        becoming more accessible to the masses.
      </p>

      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        In the sixteenth century, the Tarot of Marseilles gained popularity as a
        modified Tarot pack. Today, we find historical relics in the archives of
        renowned institutions like the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris,
        containing Major Arcana cards believed to be hand-painted around 1392.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        The Pierpont Morgan Library in New York possesses 35 cards from a
        78-card Tarot deck dating back to circa 1484, linked to Cardinal Ascanio
        Maria Sforza or his mother Bianca Visconti Sforza.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Early European cards related to the Tarot pack include the Tarocchi of
        Mantegna, the Tarocchi of Venice or Lombardi, the Tarocchino of Bologna,
        and the Minchiate of Florence. These variations added depth and richness
        to the evolving Tarot tradition.

      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Over the centuries, Tarot cards have intrigued scholars, occultists, and
        enthusiasts. Important works by various authors have delved into
        different aspects of Tarot cards, shedding light on their symbolism and
        divinatory potential.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        One pivotal moment in Tarot's history was the creation of the "Rider
        Deck." Under Dr. Waite's guidance, the deck was designed by Miss Pamela
        Colman Smith, an American artist and a fellow member of The Order of the
        Golden Dawn. Her innovative approach presented all cards, including the
        pip cards, in emblematic designs suitable for divination.

        Tarot cards, with their colorful and intriguing history, continue to

        Today, Tarot cards are more popular than ever, sought after by people
